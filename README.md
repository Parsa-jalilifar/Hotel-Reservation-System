### Introduction:
Hotel ABC is one of the famous tourist hotels in XYZ city. But this hotel’s current reservation is based on manual system. When guests come in to make reservation details are recorded in a file and then those files are stored in special cabinets. Also the billing system is manual too.

As the current system is manual based, management of the hotel has to put extra efforts to keep the data secured. Record can easily be destroyed in case of fire, disaster or even possible to be stolen. Also keeping files take extra cabinets to store them into, searching a record is very hard, which in results put lots of man hours. As well as billing system are manually handled so having an error in calculation is also at high risk.

We have decided to develop their Reservation system as a computer based system and hotel can give quick service to the guests.

### Objectives:
- Computerized system to replace the manual reservation system.
- Save time of hotel employees and guests.
- Develop a data structure which stores guest’s details when they arrive for reservation.- Create and easy to understand user friendly environment.
- The customers can book the room via phone or in person.
- The billing system should provide a bill against each reservation made at check out.
